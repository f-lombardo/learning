# Learning Kubernetes

[Kind](https://kind.sigs.k8s.io/) is a tool that is useful for doing some experiments on your local PC while leaning Kubernetes.

After installing Kind on your machine, you can create a local Kubernetes cluster with a master node and two workers with 
this command that points to a sample [configuration file](kind/create_cluster.yaml)
```shell
kind create cluster --config create_cluster.yaml
```
