# My notes on [7 minutes, 26 seconds, and the Fundamental Theorem of Agile Software Development](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WSes_PexXcA) by J.B. Rainsberger

The Fundamental Theorem of Agile Software Development is this. Let's suppose that we can actually make an estimate on time needed to release a feature. This estimate is function of two variables: the intrinsic complexity of the problem and the accidental complexity. The latter is generated by poor software design.
But usually, when we make an estimate, we just focus on the former, while, many times, solving accidental complexity is dominant.

We can reduce accidental complexity writing software with TDD. How to do tha?
1) Think carefully before start writing (is that some form of Big Upfront Design?)
2) Write a failing test that is really simple to understand. Look at the test and see if it can be written in a simpler way.
3) Write just the code that make the test pass.
4) Clean up the kitchen!

My doubt here is that if we write (point 3) a code that is too simple (or too stupid) we then have a lot of dirt in the kitchen to clean up.

Another question is: are we sure that accidental complexity derives just from bad code? Isn't it created by bad system architectures too?
